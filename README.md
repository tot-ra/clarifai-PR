| Importance | File Path | Line Number(s) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ðŸ”´ | src/workers/darknet.ts | 177-179 |Removed the newly added lines, causing a division by zero error.|
| ðŸ”µ | src/workers/darknet.ts | Various | Refactor to use `Promise.all()` or a similar method to allow for concurrent processing of multiple files. This will lead to a significant performance improvement, especially so when dealing with larger numbers of files. |
| ðŸ”µ | src/workers/darknet.ts | Various | It is recommended to use try-catch with async-await in order to improve error handling. |
| ðŸ”µ | src/workers/darknet.ts | Various | It can be improved to use JSDoc comments for better code readability and tooling. This would include to functions with comments briefly explaining what they're doing and their parameters. |
| ðŸŸ  | src/workers/darknet.ts | 152 | Each time we read a file using `fs.readFileSync()`, this operation blocks the entire thread until it finishes. This could be mitigated by considering using `fs.promises.readFile()`, which is asynchronous and returns a promise. |
